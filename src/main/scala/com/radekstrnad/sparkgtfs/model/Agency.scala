  *                         be correctly escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for
  *                         a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.
  * @param agency_timezone	The agency_timezone field contains the timezone where the transit agency is located.

  *                         This setting defines capitalization rules and other language-specific settings for all text
  *                         contained in this transit agency's feed. Please refer to

  *                         service area. It can and should contain punctuation marks to group the digits of the number.
  *                         Dialable text (for example, TriMet's "503-238-RIDE") is permitted, but the field must not
  *                         contain any other descriptive text.
  * @param agency_fare_url	The agency_fare_url specifies the URL of a web page that allows a rider to purchase tickets
  *                         or other fare instruments for that agency online. The value must be a fully qualified URL
  *                         that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly
  *                         escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description

  *                         department. This email address will be considered a direct contact point where transit
